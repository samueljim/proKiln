  <h4>Connecting a Kiln Controller to a Kiln</h4>
  Place the controller next to your own kiln. Connect the two wires that are attached to the thermocouple on your kiln to the two nodes marked "Thermocouple" on the kiln controller. Next, connect the positive and negitive wires from the SSR to the two other nodes on the controller marked as + and - respectively.
  <h4>Creating a Schedule</h4>
  Schedules can be created in the Schedule List Viewer that can be accessed from the “Schedule” tab along the navigation bar. Clicking the plus will create a new schedule, where a name and description can be entered.
  <h4>Creating a Program</h4>
  Select a schedule from the Schedule List View. The first segment of the program is created and the rate, goal and hold can be edited. New segments can be added by clicking the “add segment” button. Each new segment will hold the same rate and goal as the previous section with a hold of zero. These new segments can also be edited.
